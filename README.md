# LaraChain v2

This is a major update to LaraChain. Been working on other projects for the past year and going to do what I can to simplify the setup and foundation so anyone can get going embedding, search, and chatting with their data!


## Getting Started

### Embeddings and PostGres

You will need this to search your data so make sure after running migrations to do:

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION vector;
```




## Some links for later
And just thinking how to make some of those flows work in a Laravel environment
