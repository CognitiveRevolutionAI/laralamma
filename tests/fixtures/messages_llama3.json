We measure the \nthroughput of the software delivery process \nusing lead time of code changes from check-in \nto release along with deployment frequency.  \nStability is measured using time to restore\nthe time it takes from detecting a user-\nimpacting incident to having it remediated\nand change fail rate, a measure of the quality \nof the release process.\nPERFORMANCE METRICS  10\nFive metrics of delivery  \nand operational performance\nThe four metrics of software delivery performance  \ncan be considered in terms of throughput and stability. \nWe measure throughput using lead time for code \nchanges (that is, time from code commit to release  \nin production), and deployment frequency.  \nWe measure stability using time to restore a service \nafter an incident and change failure rate.\nA fifth metric represents operational performance  \nand is a measure of modern operational practices.  \nWe base operational performance on reliability, \nwhich is how well your services meet user expectations, \nsuch as availability and performance. Historically we \nmeasured availability rather than reliability, but because \navailability is a specific focus of reliability engineering, \nwe expanded to measure reliability in 2021 so that \navailability, latency, performance, and scalability would \nbe more broadly represented. Specifically, we asked \nrespondents to rate their ability to meet or exceed  \ntheir reliability targets. We found that teams with \nvarying degrees of delivery performance see better \noutcomes (e.g., less burnout) when they also prioritize \noperational performance. \nHow do you compare?\nLead time \nfor changes\nMTTR\nDeployment \nfrequency\nChange \nfailure rate\nOperational\nReliability\nAccelerate State of DevOps 2022   18Accelerate: State of DevOps 2019   |    How Do We Compare? \nAspect of Software Delivery Performance*\tElite High\tMedium Low\nDeployment frequency\nFor the primary application or service you work on, how  \noften does your organization deploy code to production  \nor release it to end users?\n \nOn-demand  \n(multiple  \ndeploys per day)\n \nBetween once \nper day and \nonce per week\n \nBetween once  \nper week and  \nonce per month\n \nBetween once \nper month and \nonce every six \nmonths\nLead time for changes\nFor the primary application or service you work on, what is your  \nlead time for changes (i.e., how long does it take to go from code  \ncommitted to code successfully running in production)?\nLess than  \none day\nBetween one \nday and  \none week\nBetween one \nweek and  \none month\nBetween one \nmonth and  \nsix months\nTime to restore service\nFor the primary application or service you work on, how long  \ndoes it generally take to restore service when a service incident  \nor a defect that impacts users occurs (e.g., unplanned outage or  \nservice impairment)?\nLess than  \none hour\n \nLess than  \none day\na\n \nLess than  \none day\na\nBetween one \nweek and  \none month\nChange failure rate\nFor the primary application or service you work on, what percentage \nof changes to production or released to users result in degraded \nservice (e.g., lead to service impairment or service outage) and \nsubsequently require remediation (e.g., require a hotfix, rollback,  \nfix forward, patch)?\n0-15%\nb,c\n \n0-15%\nb,d\n \n0-15%\nc,d\n \n46-60%\nMedians reported because distributions are not normal.\nAll differences are significantly different based on Tukeys post hoc analysis except where otherwise noted. \na,b,c  Means are significantly different based on Tukeys post hoc analysis; medians do not exhibit differences because of underlying distributions. \nd Means are not significantly different based on Tukeys post hoc analysis.\n*For a visual presentation of the Four Metrics, please see Appendix A. \n   9\nSoftware delivery and  \noperational performance\nTo meet the demands of their ever-changing \nindustries, organizations must deliver and operate \nsoftware quickly and reliably. The faster your teams \ncan make changes to your software, the sooner you \ncan deliver value to your customers, run experiments, \nand receive valuable feedback. With eight years of \ndata collection and research, we have developed and \nvalidated four metrics that measure software delivery \nperformance. Since 2018, weve included a fifth metric \nHow do you compare?\nAccelerate State of DevOps 2022\nto capture operational capabilities. Teams that excel \nin all five measures exhibit exceptional organizational \nperformance. We call these five measures software \ndelivery and operational (SDO) performance. Note \nthat these metrics focus on system-level outcomes, \nwhich helps avoid the common pitfalls of tracking \nsoftware metrics, that may result in pitting functions \nagainst each other and making local optimizations  \nat the cost of overall outcomes.     15Accelerate: State of DevOps 2019   |    How Do We Compare? 15 \nOrganizations increasingly rely on their ability to deliver \nand operate software systems to achieve their goals.  \nTo compare performance on this key outcome metric, \nthe industry needs a way to measure the effectiveness \nof their development and delivery practices. Over the \nlast six years we have developed and validated four \nmetrics that provide a high-level systems view of \nsoftware delivery and performance and predict an \norganizations ability to achieve its goals. Last year,  \nwe added an additional metric focused on operational \ncapabilities, and found that this measure helps \norganizations deliver superior outcomes. We call  \nthese five measures software delivery and \noperational (SDO) performance, which focus \non system-level outcomes. This helps avoid the \ncommon pitfalls of software metrics, which often pit \ndifferent functions against each other and result in \nlocal optimizations at the cost of overall outcomes.\nSOFTWARE \nDELIVERY AND  \nOPERATIONAL \nPERFORMANCE  14How do you compare?\nClustering delivery performance  \nand operational performance\nWe decided to do a cluster analysis on the three \ncategories the five metrics are designed to represent: \nthroughput (a composite of lead time of code changes \nand deployment frequency), stability (a composite of \ntime to restore a service and change failure rate) and \noperational performance (reliability). The reason for \nthis was the pivotal role operational performance plays \nin our models. For organizations that do not show  \nsolid operational performance, throughput and  \nstability have less of an impact on organizational \nperformance. We feel that describing the landscape \nof DevOps performance without accounting for \noperational performance leaves out a crucial part  \nof the picture.\nExploring the data led us to a four cluster solution. Here \nis a breakdown of the four clusters and their names:\nCluster\nStability\nOperational \nPerformance\nThroughput\n% respondents\nTime to restore \nservice\nChange failure rateReliability Lead time\nDeployment \nfrequency\nStarting\nBetween one day and \none week\n31%-45%\nSometimes meet \nexpectations\nBetween one \nweek and one \nmonth\nBetween once per \nweek and once per \nmonth\n28%\nFlowingLess than one hour0%-15%\nUsually meet \nexpectations\nLess than one day\nOn demand \n(multiple deploys \nper day)\n17%\nSlowingLess than one day 0%-15%\nUsually meet \nexpectations\nBetween one \nweek and one \nmonth\nBetween once per \nweek and once per \nmonth\n34%\nRetiring\nBetween one month \nand six months\n46%-60% \nUsually meet \nexpectations\nBetween one \nmonth and six \nmonths\nBetween once per \nmonth and once \nevery 6 months\n21%\nAccelerate State of DevOps 2022  Accelerate: State of DevOps 2019   |    Executive Summary   4\ninitiatives such as supporting \ninformation search, more usable \ndeployment toolchains, and reducing \ntechnical debt through flexible \narchitecture, code maintainability,  \nand viewable systems. \nOur research continues to show that \nthe industry-standard Four Key Metrics\n1\n \nof software development and delivery \ndrive organizational performance in \ntechnology transformations. This years \nreport revalidates previous findings \nthat it is possible to optimize for \nstability without sacrificing speed.  \nWe also the identify the capabilities  \nthat drive improvement in the Four Key \nMetrics, including technical practices,  \ncloud adoption, organizational practices \n(including change approval processes),  \nand culture. \nFor organizations seeking guidance on  \nhow to improve, we point to the only real path \nforward: Start with foundations, and \tthen \nadopt a continuous improvement mindset  \nby identifying your unique constraint (or set  \nof constraints). Once those constraints no \nlonger hold you back, repeat the process. \nWe also provide guidance on the most \neffective strategies for enacting these changes. \n1  https:\/\/www.thoughtworks.com\/radar\/techniques\/four-key-metrics  Beyond the four keys \nHow do DORA metrics \nimprove the performance of \ndevelopment and operations? \nA cross-functional team of \nsoftware engineers at Liberty \nMutual Insurance regularly \nreviews performance using \nDORAs four keys metrics. \nFor example, Jenna Dailey, Sr. \nScrum Master at Liberty Mutual, \nshared that a squad leveraged \nDORAs research to help the \nteam identify a bottleneck, \nmove towards a test-driven \ndevelopment approach, and \nrealize improvements in their \noverall performance.\nLearn more about Liberty \nMutuals approach to leveraging \ndata and DORA metrics to \nimprove the quality and delivery \nof software in their recent \nTomorrow Talks.\n20How do you improve?\nThe research model shifted this year to better reflect \na theory underlying DORA: there isnt a one-size-fits-\nall approach to DevOps. In practice, weve found that \nmaking recommendations involves understanding a \nteams broader context. A practice that is beneficial to \none team might be detrimental to another team. For \nexample, we have long hypothesized that technical \ncapabilities (such as loosely-coupled architecture, \ntrunk based development, version control, and \ncontinuous integration) have a more pronounced \npositive impact on software delivery performance \nwhen continuous delivery is in place. This year we \nexplicitly modeled this and other interactions. The \ngoal is to enhance our understanding from simply \nwhat has an effect on what? to include under what \nconditions do these effects exist, get amplified, or \nget attenuated? Understanding all this conditionality \nhas proven to be a complicated and mind-bending \nendeavor, but were excited to share with you some of \nthese early findings.\nYou can find this years and previous years research \nmodels online on our website\t.\nAccelerate State of DevOps 2022   23Accelerate: State of DevOps 2019   |    How Do We Compare? \nChange lead time\nSimilarly, elite performers report change \nlead times of less than one day, with change \nlead time measured as the time from code \ncommitted to having that code successfully \ndeployed in production. This is a small \ndecrease in performance from last year, when \nour highest performers reported change lead \ntimes of less than one hour. In contrast to our \nelite performers, low performers required lead \ntimes between one month and six months. \nWith lead times of 24 hours for elite performers \n(a conservative estimate at the high end of \nless than one day) and 2,555 hours for low \nperformers (the mean of 730 hours per month \nand 4,380 hours over six months), the elite \ngroup has 106 times faster change lead times \nthan low performers.    25Accelerate: State of DevOps 2019   |    How Do We Compare? \nSOFTWARE DELIVERY  \nPERFORMANCE \nAll of the measures shown are relative; that \nis, they compare the highest and the lowest \nperformers each year. From 2018 to 2019, the \ngap for all performance metrics between \nthe lowest and highest performers increased \nor stayed the same, with the exception of lead \ntime for changes. The increased gap in deploy \nfrequency indicates a decrease in performance \namong low performers, which may be due \nto growing complexity in environments and \ntherefore difficulty in delivering software.  \nThe reduced ratio of the lowest to the highest \nperformers in lead time represents a reduction \nin the performance of the highest performing \ngroup, which is seeing lead times increase  \nfrom less than an hour to between an hour  \nand a day. This may reflect the trend in more \nheavyweight code review and approval \nprocesses that have become popular  \nin recent years.\n2019\n208x\nMore Frequent\nDeploy Frequency \n2604x\nFaster Time to \nRestore Service\n106x\nFaster  \nLead TIme \n7x  \nLower Change  \nFail Rate \n2018\n46x\nMore Frequent\nDeploy Frequency \n2604x\nFaster Time to \nRestore Service  \n2555x\nFaster  \nLead TIme\n7x  \nLower Change  \nFail Rate\n \nComparing highest to lowest performers.
