Before forwarding the question to the LLM, we have a layer that searches our knowledge\nbase for the relevant knowledge to answer the user query. Specifically, in this case, the spending data from the last month. Our LLM can now\ngenerate a relevant non-hallucinated response about our budget.\nAs your data grows, youll need efficient ways to identify the most relevant information for your LLMs limited memory. This is where youll want a\nproper way to store and retrieve the specific data youll need for your query, without needing the LLM to remember it.\nVector databases store information as vector embeddings. This format supports efficient similarity searches to retrieve relevant data for your\nquery. For example, Qdrant is specifically designed to perform fast, even in scenarios dealing with billions of vectors.\nThis article will focus on RAG systems and architecture. If youre interested in learning more about vector search, we recommend the following\narticles: What is a Vector Database? and What are Vector Embeddings?.\nRAG architecture\nAt its core, a RAG architecture includes the retriever and the generator. Lets start by understanding what each of these components does.\nThe Retriever\nWhen you ask a question to the retriever, it uses similarity search to scan through a vast knowledge base of vector embeddings. It then pulls out\nthe most relevant vectors to help answer that query. There are a few different techniques it can use to know whats relevant:\nHow indexing works in RAG retrievers\nThe indexing process organizes the data into your vector database in a way that makes it easily searchable. This allows the RAG to access relevant\ninformation when responding to a query.\nLearn more\tI acceptWe use cookies to learn more about you.

It searches a database for information beyond its pre-trained knowledge base, significantly improving the accuracy and\nrelevance of the generated responses.\nLanguage models have exploded on the internet ever since ChatGPT came out, and rightfully so. They can write essays, code entire programs, and\neven make memes (though were still deciding on whether thats a good thing).\nBut as brilliant as these chatbots become, they still have limitations in tasks requiring external knowledge and factual information. Yes, it can\ndescribe the honeybees waggle dance in excruciating detail. But they become far more valuable if they can generate insights from any data that\nwe provide, rather than just their original training data. Since retraining those large language models from scratch costs millions of dollars and\ntakes months, we need better ways to give our existing LLMs access to our custom data.\nWhile you could be more creative with your prompts, it is only a short-term solution. LLMs can consider only a limited amount of text in their\nresponses, known as a context window. Some models like GPT-3 can see up to around 12 pages of text (thats 4,096 tokens of context). Thats not\ngood enough for most knowledge bases.\nProduct Resources CommunityCloud Cloud  GitHub GitHub  \nLearn more\tI acceptWe use cookies to learn more about you.

These models are compact\nnumerical representations that capture semantic meaning. Vector databases like Qdrant store these embeddings, allowing retrieval based on\nsemantic similarity rather than just keywords using distance metrics like cosine similarity.\nThis allows the retriever to match based on semantic understanding rather than just keywords. So if I ask about compounds that cause BO, it can\nretrieve relevant info about molecules that create body odor even if those exact words werent used. We explain more about it in our What are\nVector Embeddings article.\nHybrid search\nHowever, neither keyword search nor vector search are always perfect. Keyword search may miss relevant information expressed differently,\nwhile vector search can sometimes struggle with specificity or neglect important statistical word patterns. Hybrid methods aim to combine the\nstrengths of different techniques.\nSome common hybrid approaches include:\nUsing keyword search to get an initial set of candidate documents. Next, the documents are re-ranked\/re-scored using semantic vector\nrepresentations.\nStarting with semantic vectors to find generally topically relevant documents. Next, the documents are filtered\/re-ranked e based on\nkeyword matches or other metadata.\nConsidering both semantic vector closeness and statistical keyword patterns\/weights in a combined scoring model.\nHaving multiple stages were different techniques. One example: start with an initial keyword retrieval, followed by semantic re-ranking, then\na final re-ranking using even more complex models.\nWhen you combine the powers of different search methods in a complementary way, you can provide higher quality, more comprehensive results.\nCheck out our article on Hybrid Search if youd like to learn more.\nThe Generator\nWith the top relevant passages retrieved, its now the generators job to produce a final answer by synthesizing and expressing that information in\nnatural language.\nThe LLM is typically a model like GPT, BART or T5, trained on massive datasets to understand and generate human-like text. It now takes not only\nthe query (or question) as input but also the relevant documents or passages that the retriever identified as potentially containing the answer to\ngenerate its response.\nLearn more\tI acceptWe use cookies to learn more about you.
