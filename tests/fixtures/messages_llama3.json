SYNOPSIS\nfor the primary analytical strategy, neither estimate nor \nvariance differed. The total sample size producing this \nsummary estimate was 34,719 (Table 1). \nFewer articles and estimates were available for \nthe diagnostic sensitivity analyses. For the sensitivity \nanalysis based on 35 estimates (sample size of 9,446 \nobtained from 5 articles) that did not distinguish be-\ntween IgG and IgM results, seropositivity was 14.5% \n(95% CI 11.8%17.2%). For the sensitivity analysis \nthat used a 2-tier testing system (16 estimates ob-\ntained from 6 articles with a sample size of 8,837), se-\nropositivity was 1.8% (95% CI 0.9%2.7%) (Table 1).\nSeropositivity for the clinical suspicion sample was \n7.1% (95% CI 6.4%8.0%). Lyme disease seropositiv-\nity estimates by exposure risk populations were 4.5% \n(95% CI 3.9%5.1%) for low risk, 6.1% (95% CI 5.4%\n6.7%) for medium risk, and 10.0% (95% CI 9.6%10.4%) \nfor high risk (Table 1). The odds ratio of high exposure \nrisk seropositivity compared with low exposure risk \nseropositivity was 2.4 (95% CI 2.12.7) and of moderate \nexposure risk seropositivity compared with low expo-\nsure risk seropositivity was 1.4 (95% CI 1.21.6).\nVariation by province was substantial; the high-\nest seropositivity estimates were 23.1% for Heilongji-\nang Province and 16.2% for Neimenggu (Inner Mon-\ngolia) Province (Figure 2). Moreover, variation across \nprovinces was substantial (Figure 3). There was no \ndiscernable trend over time for seropositivity (data \nnot shown).\nDiscussion\nOur systematic literature review of B. burgdorferi se-\nropositivity in China generated summary estimates \nby diagnostic test, exposure risk, sex, age group, \nprovince, and year. Depending on the testing algo-\nrithm applied, the seropositivity ranged from 1.8% to \n14.5%, reflecting Lyme disease endemicity in the pop-\nulation. Combined with the widespread distribution \nof Ixodes ticks, specifically I. persulcatus ticks in many \nprovinces, this analysis reinforces that Lyme disease \nis a public health problem in China.\nThe summary estimates of 9.1% among EIA\/IFA \npositive samples and 1.8% among samples confirmed \nwith WB fell within the range identified in Europe. In \nGermany, the nationwide, population-based cross-\nsectional KiGGS study estimated seropositivity among \nchildren and adolescents of 4.8% by single-tier ELISA \ntesting (4% when confirmed by line blot) (14). A similar \nnationwide, population-based, cross-sectional study \namong adults in Germany (DEGS) reported overall \nseropositivity of 9.4%, confirmed by line blot (15). A \ncross-sectional health survey among a representative \nsample of adults in Finland reported seropositivity of \n3.9% according to 2-tier testing (16). A representative \nsample of healthy blood donors from the Tyrol region \nof Austria reported a seropositivity range of 1.5%7.2% \nfrom samples confirmed by line blot (17). A regional \nstudy in Turkey among healthy volunteers revealed \nseropositivity of 4.1% by single-tier testing with ELISA \nand 2.2% confirmed by WB (18).\nIn China, results of the diagnostic sensitivity \nanalyses were consistent with expectations based on \nLyme diagnostic testing limitations. Several studies \ndid not adequately delineate the results by IgM or \nIgG positivity, and this joint numerator resulted in a \nsubstantially higher estimate than IgG seropositivity \n2392 \tEmerging Infectious Diseases  www.cdc.gov\/eid  Vol. 28, No. 12, December 2022 \n \nTable 1.

Our study, however, found that 60% of adults and 71% of care-\ngivers were likely or very likely to get vaccinated against LD if a \nvaccine were available. Differences across study samples could \naccount for some of the variations in vaccine intention estimates. \nOur respondents were drawn from a broader population (i.e.all 16 \nendemic states), whereas respondents from both Hook, Hansen, \netal.(2022) and Niesobecki et\tal.(2019) were exclusively from \na select few endemic states. In addition to broader coverage, \nour quota-\tbased sampling technique led to a more representa-\ntive group of respondents. For example, 23% of the Adult sam-\nple and 36% of the Caregiver sample reported income of greater \nthan $100,000, while 53% of the respondents in Niesobecki \netal.(2019) reported an income greater than $100,000. While \nthe specific relationship between LD vaccination intention and \nincome is not well studied, higher median household income has \nbeen found to be associated with higher community COVID-\t19 \nvaccination rates (Masterson etal.,2023\t).\nShadick etal.(2016), which applied the HBM to educational ini-\ntiatives for LD, found that educational programmes that included el-\nements of awareness and knowledge of LD, benefits of preventative \nbehaviour, and self-\tefficacy can improve knowledge, attitude and \nself-\treported precautionary behaviour among at-\trisk children. While \ntheir study methodology and scope differ from ours, the importance \nof perceived benefits in preventative behaviour aligns with our find-\nings. Jacob et al.(2019), which used an HBM focused on LD pre-\nvention at the municipal level, found that barriers to implementing \npreventive interventions moderated the intention-\timplementation \nrelationship, suggesting that while barriers may not be significant \npredictors of intention to vaccinate, they could become significant \npredictors of whether a person would follow through on receiving \na vaccine.\nWhile our study contributes to the growing literature on LD and \ndrivers of vaccination uptake, we acknowledge the study's limita-\ntions. Although we implemented quotas to ensure that the demo-\ngraphics of the sample would approximate those of the underlying \npopulation and distributed the survey through a panel that has \nshown to be demographically representative of the United States \n(Boas et al.,2020), the final sample slightly oversampled respon-\ndents who identified as White.\niv\n Survey panels more broadly may \nalso have inherent limitations, which includes the tendency for panel \nmembers to be more educated than non-\tpanel members (Callegaro \netal.,2014; Hays et al.,2015). Moreover, while we found the HBM \nto be a strong framework to identify key drivers associated with \nvaccination intention, we acknowledge that it does not capture all \nfactors associated with vaccination intention (e.g. socioeconomic \nstatus, ethnicity, education level). Lastly, the question on the inten-\ntion to vaccinate was for a generic LD vaccine and not specific to \na vaccine with defined attributes (e.g. schedule, efficacy, safety), \nand therefore may either underestimate or overestimate intention \nfor a future vaccine. Regardless, the data and study indicate the \nimportance of ongoing research on LD vaccination uptake. Future \nrenditions of similar research may consider conducting HBMs with \nFIGURE 1Prediction of adult intention to vaccinate from Health \nBelief Model (HBM). ***, **, and * denote a p\t- value of < 0.001, 0.01, \nand 0.05.\nPerceived \nsusceptibility\nPerceived severity\nPerceived benefits\nPerceived barriers\nSafety concerns\nCue to action\nIntention to \nVaccinate\n0.20***\n0.04\n0.17***\n-0.16***\n-0.04\n0.49***\nFIGURE 2Prediction of caregiver intention to vaccinate from \nHealth Belief Model (HBM). ***, **, and * denote a p\t- value of \n<0.001, 0.01, and 0.05.\nPerceived \nsusceptibility\nPerceived severity\nPerceived benefits\nPerceived barriers\nSafety concerns\nCue to action\nIntention to \nVaccinate\n0.13***\n0.06*\n0.17***\n-0.05\n-0.08**\n0.53***\nFIGURE 3Prediction of intention to vaccinate from Health \nBelief Model (HBM) for interaction terms. ***, **, and denote a \np- value of <0.001, 0.01, and 0.05.\nPerceived \nsusceptibility \n(interaction)\nPerceived severity \n(interaction)\nPerceived benefits\n(interaction)\nPerceived barriers\n(interaction)\nSafety concerns\n(interaction)\nCue to action\n(interaction)\nIntention to \nVaccinate\n-0.14*\n0.06\n-0.05\n0.17***\n-0.08\n0.09 18632378, 0, Downloaded from https:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/zph.13107 by Pfizer Inc Groton, Wiley Online Library on [05\/01\/2024].

Qualtrics panellists were re-\ncruited from various sources including but not limited to member \nreferrals, targeted email lists and social media. The panel members \nwere sent email invitations or prompted on the survey platform \nwith generic language that provided details about the incentive and \na hyperlink to the survey (Qualtrics,\t2023). Qualtrics recruited re-\nspondents to partake in the survey and compensated them for com-\npleting the survey.\nThe sample frame was defined as US states endemic for LD, \nand the population size for the sample frame was retrieved from \nthe US Census Bureau(2023). Sample sizes of 800 for both adults \nand caregivers were required to achieve a margin of error of 3%, \nusing a confidence level of 95%. The surveys were piloted in April \n2023, and the final data were collected from 21 April to 22 May \n2023. Study materials were reviewed and approved by Advarra, an \nindependent Institutional Review Board service, before the sur-\nveys were fielded.\n2.2| Participant eligibility\nSurvey eligibility required residing in an endemic state and being \n18years of age or older. Quotas were included for age, sex and race\/\nethnicity to ensure representative samples across these character-\nistics. Additionally, a quota required 25% of the sample to reside in \na large city to approximate the urban distribution of the population \n(Miller et al.,2012) and to ensure sufficient representation from re-\nspondents in rural and suburban areas where LD incidence is higher. \nItems were also included to gather respondent education and in-\ncome levels. The specific wording for the demographic characteris-\ntic questions is provided in TableS1.\n2.3| Measures\nVaccine intention was assessed with two items from the survey. \nMost of the HBM constructs were also measured with two separate \nsurvey items (i.e. perceived susceptibility and severity to LD, per-\nceived benefits to vaccine uptake and cues to action). The exception \nwas the perceived barriers construct which was measured with four \nitemstwo items focused on constraints associated with receiving a \nLD vaccine and two items focused on the safety concerns of receiv-\ning a LD vaccine (a subcategory for barriers).\nii\nThe wording of items for vaccine intention and HBM constructs \nwere adapted from previous studies (Gerend & Shepherd,2012; \nHook, Hansen, et\tal.,2022; Shmueli, 2021), with modifications \nto improve specificity for LD and to remove redundancies when \nappropriate. Responses for vaccine intention and the HBM \nconstructs were elicited using 5-\tpoint Likert scales (i.e. 1=\tvery \nunlikely5=very likely for vaccine intention and 1=\tstrongly dis-\nagree5=strongly agree for HBM constructs) to each item. The \nspecific wording of these items and the frequency of responses are \nprovided in TableS2. Briefly, the two vaccine intention items asked \nrespondents about the likelihood of getting a LD vaccine if it were \navailable and if it were offered in the next year. The two perceived \nsusceptibility items asked about the vulnerability of contracting LD \nand the likelihood of someone in their household contracting LD in \nthe future. Perceived severity items asked about the consequences \nand seriousness of contracting LD. Perceived benefit items asked if \na vaccine would reduce the risk of contracting LD and the chances \nof contracting a severe form of LD. Perceived barrier items asked \nif out-\tof-\tpocket costs and multiple doses would reduce the likeli-\nhood of getting vaccinated for LD. Perceived safety concern items, \na subcategory of barriers (as noted earlier), asked if concerns about \nside effects and general safety reduced the likelihood of getting \nvaccinated for LD. Lastly, cues to action items asked about the \nlikelihood of receiving the LD vaccine if it were recommended by \na healthcare provider and the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention (CDC).\n2.4| Data analysis\nSurvey responses were screened by Qualtrics to remove respond-\nents who failed an attention check, sped through the survey or ex-\nhibited a straight-\tlining response behaviour to ensure data quality. \nThe data were then checked again for these criteria by a researcher \nbefore analysis to further ensure data quality.\nCronbach's alphas were estimated to determine the internal \nconsistencies of multiple items asked to measure intention to vac-\ncinate and each HBM construct. A Cronbach alpha threshold equal \nto or greater than 0.80 indicates that the items reliably measure the \nsame construct (Peterson,1994). Therefore, construct items with a \nCronbach alpha over this threshold were combined into a single vari-\nable by taking the mean of the items within a construct.\nPrevious research has relied on structural equation model-\nling (SEM) to determine the predictors of vaccine intention (e.g. \nGerend & Shepherd,2012; Rajamoorthy et\tal.,2018), because \nSEM estimates relationships for theoretical frameworks, like \nHBM, while accounting for measurement errors in the observed \npredictors. The relationship between HBM constructs and vaccine \nintention was first estimated using separate SEM models for the \nAdult and Caregiver samples. Then, data from the two samples \nwere combined to build a model that included interaction terms \nbetween HBM constructs and an indicator variable for caregivers \nto determine whether there was heterogeneity in the influence of \npredictors between the samples (referred to as the full model). \nFinally, another model was estimated for the combined data that \ndid not include the interaction terms; this model was estimated \nto determine whether the interaction terms improved model fit \nusing a likelihood-\tratio test (referred to as the restricted model).  18632378, 0, Downloaded from https:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/zph.13107 by Pfizer Inc Groton, Wiley Online Library on [05\/01\/2024].

Significance is reported for predictors with p-\nvalues less than 0.05 to focus on the most robust and statistically \nsignificant predictors.\n3|RESULTS\n3.1| Demographics characteristics\nThe demographic characteristics of study respondents are \nshown in Table1. For the Adult survey (n=874), the majority of \nrespondents were White (68%), female (54%) and between the \nages of 2554years old (52%), and almost half (45%) reported \nhaving a Bachelor's, Graduate, or professional degree. For the \nCaregiver survey (n=834), most respondents were White (68%), \nmale (51%) and between the ages of 2554years old (63%), and \nhalf (50%) reported having a Bachelor's, graduate or professional \ndegree.\n3.2| Health belief model overview\nAs shown in Table2, estimates of Cronbach's alpha () were 0.90 \nfor the vaccine intention items in both samples and alphas for \nitems in the HBM constructs ranged from 0.80 to 0.87. Thus, com-\nbined variables were created for vaccine intention and the HBM \nconstructs by taking the mean of items within a measurement \n(also shown in Table2). Relative to the Adult sample, caregivers \nhad higher perceived LD susceptibility and severity, more concern \nabout vaccine safety, and cues to action were more influential. \nAdults reported both higher perceived benefits of and barriers to \nLD vaccination.\n3.3| Structural equation modelling (SEM)\nTo determine the influence of HBM constructs on the intention to \nvaccinate against LD, SEM models were estimated. The SEM esti-\nmates for the HBM constructs in the Adult model provided a good \nfit to vaccine intention (X\n2\n=886.53***, CFI=1.00, RMSEA=0.00, \nR\n2\n=0.64). The standardized path coefficients are presented in \nFigure1. Significant predictors for intention to vaccinate against \nLD for adults included perceived susceptibility (0.20), perceived \nbenefits (0.17), perceived barriers (0.16) and cues to action (0.49). \nThe construct for cues to action was the largest predictor of vaccine \nintention.\nThe SEM estimates for the HBM constructs also pro -\nvided a good fit for vaccine intention in the Caregiver model \n(X\n2\n=772.11***, CFI=\t1.00, RMSEA=\t0.00, R\n2\n=0.60).

Our study, however, found that 60% of adults and 71% of care-\ngivers were likely or very likely to get vaccinated against LD if a \nvaccine were available. Differences across study samples could \naccount for some of the variations in vaccine intention estimates. \nOur respondents were drawn from a broader population (i.e.all 16 \nendemic states), whereas respondents from both Hook, Hansen, \netal.(2022) and Niesobecki et\tal.(2019) were exclusively from \na select few endemic states. In addition to broader coverage, \nour quota-\tbased sampling technique led to a more representa-\ntive group of respondents.

The total sample size producing this \nsummary estimate was 34,719 (Table 1). \nFewer articles and estimates were available for \nthe diagnostic sensitivity analyses. For the sensitivity \nanalysis based on 35 estimates (sample size of 9,446 \nobtained from 5 articles) that did not distinguish be-\ntween IgG and IgM results, seropositivity was 14.5% \n(95% CI 11.8%17.2%). For the sensitivity analysis \nthat used a 2-tier testing system (16 estimates ob-\ntained from 6 articles with a sample size of 8,837), se-\nropositivity was 1.8% (95% CI 0.9%2.7%) (Table 1).\nSeropositivity for the clinical suspicion sample was \n7.1% (95% CI 6.4%8.0%). Lyme disease seropositiv-\nity estimates by exposure risk populations were 4.5% \n(95% CI 3.9%5.1%) for low risk, 6.1% (95% CI 5.4%\n6.7%) for medium risk, and 10.0% (95% CI 9.6%10.4%) \nfor high risk (Table 1). The odds ratio of high exposure \nrisk seropositivity compared with low exposure risk \nseropositivity was 2.4 (95% CI 2.12.7) and of moderate \nexposure risk seropositivity compared with low expo-\nsure risk seropositivity was 1.4 (95% CI 1.21.6).\nVariation by province was substantial; the high-\nest seropositivity estimates were 23.1% for Heilongji-\nang Province and 16.2% for Neimenggu (Inner Mon-\ngolia) Province (Figure 2). Moreover, variation across \nprovinces was substantial (Figure 3). There was no \ndiscernable trend over time for seropositivity (data \nnot shown).\nDiscussion\nOur systematic literature review of B. burgdorferi se-\nropositivity in China generated summary estimates \nby diagnostic test, exposure risk, sex, age group, \nprovince, and year. Depending on the testing algo-\nrithm applied, the seropositivity ranged from 1.8% to \n14.5%, reflecting Lyme disease endemicity in the pop-\nulation. Combined with the widespread distribution \nof Ixodes ticks, specifically I. persulcatus ticks in many \nprovinces, this analysis reinforces that Lyme disease \nis a public health problem in China.\nThe summary estimates of 9.1% among EIA\/IFA \npositive samples and 1.8% among samples confirmed \nwith WB fell within the range identified in Europe. In \nGermany, the nationwide, population-based cross-\nsectional KiGGS study estimated seropositivity among \nchildren and adolescents of 4.8% by single-tier ELISA \ntesting (4% when confirmed by line blot) (14). A similar \nnationwide, population-based, cross-sectional study \namong adults in Germany (DEGS) reported overall \nseropositivity of 9.4%, confirmed by line blot (15). A \ncross-sectional health survey among a representative \nsample of adults in Finland reported seropositivity of \n3.9% according to 2-tier testing (16). A representative \nsample of healthy blood donors from the Tyrol region \nof Austria reported a seropositivity range of 1.5%7.2% \nfrom samples confirmed by line blot (17). A regional \nstudy in Turkey among healthy volunteers revealed \nseropositivity of 4.1% by single-tier testing with ELISA \nand 2.2% confirmed by WB (18).\nIn China, results of the diagnostic sensitivity \nanalyses were consistent with expectations based on \nLyme diagnostic testing limitations. Several studies \ndid not adequately delineate the results by IgM or \nIgG positivity, and this joint numerator resulted in a \nsubstantially higher estimate than IgG seropositivity \n2392 \tEmerging Infectious Diseases  www.cdc.gov\/eid  Vol. 28, No. 12, December 2022 \n \nTable 1.
