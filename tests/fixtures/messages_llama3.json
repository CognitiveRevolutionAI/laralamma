We know that our responsibility begins \nwith our own carbon footprint, which is why weve taken \nsignificant steps over the past two decades to minimize our \nown emissions. In 2021, we set our most ambitious goal yet: \nto achieve net-zero emissions across all of our operations \nand value chain by 2030. To accomplish this, we aim to \nreduce 50% of our combined Scope 1, Scope 2 (market-\nbased), and Scope 3 absolute emissions (versus our 2019 \nbaseline) before 2030, and plan to invest in nature-based and \ntechnology-based carbon removal solutions to neutralize \nour remaining emissions. Weve formally committed to \nthe Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) to seek their \nvalidation of our absolute emissions reduction target.\nOne of the key levers for reducing emissions from our \noperations is transitioning to clean energy. Energy use \ncontributes to a significant share of our carbon footprint \ndue to the electricity needs of our operationsin particular, \nour data centers. Thats why, in 2020, we set a goal to \noperate our data centers and office campuses on 24\/7 \ncarbon-free energy on every grid where we operate by \n2030 (24\/7 CFE). Weve been working hard to transition our \noperations and the electricity grids that serve us to cleaner \nsources of power, through a combination of clean energy \nprocurement, technology innovation, and policy advocacy. \nAnd we expect our work to decarbonize electricity grids \nwhere we operate to contribute to decarbonization across \nour value chain as well.\nCharting our path\nAchieving net-zero emissions and 24\/7 CFE by 2030 are \nextremely ambitious goalswhat we call moonshots. \nWe also know that our path to net-zero emissions wont \nbe easy or linear; it may require us to navigate significant \nuncertainty and deploy new systems and technologies \nacross our business. Some of our plans will take years to \ndeliver their full results, particularly where they involve \nbuilding new large-scale infrastructure with long lead \ntimes. So as our business continues to evolve, we expect \nour emissions to rise before dropping towards our \nabsolute emissions reduction target.\nIn our third decade of climate action , we recognize that \nwe cant achieve our goals alone. Transitioning to a carbon-\nfree future will require stronger government policies and \npartnerships with many other organizations, as well as \nnew technologies and structural changes to the broader \nsystems that serve our operations and value chain,  \nsuch as electricity grids and hardware supply chains.
