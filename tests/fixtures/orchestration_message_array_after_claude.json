\nhowever, some Lyme patients experience persistent symptoms (e.g., post-treatment arthritis due to lasting tissue \ndamage during infection) or resolution of primary symptoms and development of non-specific symptoms (e.g., Post-\nTreatment Lyme Disease Syndrome). \nKey Messages (1\/3)  66Confidential\nThe risk of Lyme disease is emerging through expansion of Borrelia-infected tick habitats and risk is \nunpredictable among broad segments of the population which would benefit from a routine use \nrecommendation\nAnnually, there are an estimated 476,000 cases diagnosed and treated for Lyme disease in the US and 129,000 reported cases in \nEurope.\nLyme disease incidence is increasing, in part due to expanding tick habitats driven by warming temperatures and increased behaviors \nleading to greater contact with ticks [citation].\nOnce introduced, Borrelia-infected ticks can become well-established, creating regions endemic for Lyme disease.\n\nImproved surveillance efforts have contributed to observed increases in Lyme disease incidence but under ascertainment remains.\n\nLyme disease risk is a function of the relationship between the environmental hazard (ecological factors that influence tick populations \nand the maintenance of TBPs in nature) and exposure (the likelihood or rate of an individual coming in contact with an infected tick)\n\nApproximately 289 million people live in high incidence regions (87 million in US and 202 million in Europe) \nMany common day-to-day activities (e.g., recreational time spent in fields or forests, hunting, pet ownership, gardening) and outdoor \noccupations (e.g., agriculture, forestry, military) can lead to exposure to Borrelia-infected ticks\n\nExposure is not restricted to rural areas but occurs in urban areas as well.\n\nIn endemic regions, individual-level risk is multifactorial, dynamic, and difficult to quantify and communicate; individuals tend to perceive \nlow risk regardless of probability of exposure.\nFor those traveling to endemic regions, outdoor activities (e.g., hiking and camping) lead to increased risk of Lyme disease.\n\nKey Messages (2\/3)  52Confidential\nLiaison representatives share vaccine expertise and influence \ndecisions \nAffiliations of ACIP Liaison Members  51Confidential\nIn the US, ACIP consists of 15 voting members and 30 non-voting \nrepresentatives of liaison organizations \nAffiliations of ACIP Voting Members  69Confidential\nRisk\nRisk for Lyme disease is broad, dynamic, and unpredictable;

despite similarities as an OspA vaccine, \nthey are different constructs and VLA15 omits the hLFA1 epitope\n\nKey Messages (3\/3)  19Confidential\nKey Messages by Medical Value Pillar: 2020  2023 (1\/4)\nPillar Messages\tTo Whom How When\nVector & Risk\nEvidence Point 2.4: Individual risk for Lyme disease is a function of the relationship \nbetween the ecological factors that impact Borrelia-infected tick populations (hazard) and \nthe likelihood or rate of human encounters to ticks (exposure). \nNo external engagement so far\nRisk research underway\nEvidence Point 2.5: Approximately 289 million people live in high incidence areas (87 \nmillion in US and 202 million in Europe). \nEvidence Point 2.6: Many common day-to-day activities (e.g., recreational time spent in \nfields or forests, hunting, pet ownership, gardening) and outdoor occupations (e.g., \nagriculture, forestry, military) are associated with increased exposure to Borrelia-infected \nticks. \nEvidence Point 2.7: Exposure to ticks is not restricted to rural areas but occurs in urban \nareas as well. \nEvidence Point 2.8: In endemic regions, individual risk is unpredictable and difficult to \nquantify and define;
