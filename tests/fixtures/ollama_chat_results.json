The most common symptoms include:\n\n### Early Stage (3-30 days after bite)\n\n* **Rash**: A distinctive \"bull's-eye\" rash called erythema migrans appears at the site of the tick bite, often accompanied by:\n\t+ Fever\n\t+ Headache\n\t+ Fatigue\n\t+ Muscle and joint pain\n\t+ Swollen lymph nodes\n\n### Late Stage (weeks to months after infection)\n\n* **Neurological symptoms**: If left untreated, Lyme disease can spread to the nervous system, causing:\n\t+ Meningitis-like symptoms: stiff neck, headache, fever\n\t+ Neurological problems: numbness or tingling in hands and feet, Bell's palsy (facial paralysis), seizures, encephalitis\n* **Arthritis**: Joint pain and swelling, often affecting the knees, elbows, and wrists\n* **Heart problems**: Abnormal heart rhythms (atrioventricular block) and inflammation of the heart muscle\n\n### Late Latent Stage (months to years after infection)\n\n* **Persistent symptoms**: Fatigue, joint pain, arthritis, or neurological problems may persist even after treatment\n\nIt's essential to seek medical attention if you experience any of these symptoms, especially if you've been bitten by a tick in an area where Lyme disease is common. Early diagnosis and treatment can help prevent long-term complications and alleviate symptoms."
