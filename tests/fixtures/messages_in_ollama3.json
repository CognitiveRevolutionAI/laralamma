The three stages are:\n\n1. **Early Localized Stage (3-30 days after tick bite):**\n* Erythema migrans (EM): A characteristic circular, expanding rash that may clear in the center, usually appearing at the site of the tick bite.\n* Flu-like symptoms: Fever, chills, fatigue, body aches, headache, and swollen lymph nodes.\n1. **Early Disseminated Stage (days to weeks after tick bite):**\n* Additional EM rashes on other parts of the body.\n* Neurological symptoms: Facial palsy (loss of muscle tone or droop on one or both sides of the face), impaired muscle movement, meningitis (inflammation of the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord), and neuropathy (nerve pain).\n* Cardiac problems: Irregular heartbeat, heart block, and inflammation of the heart muscle.\n* Joint inflammation and pain (Lyme arthritis): Swelling and pain in large joints like knees and other joints throughout the body.\n1. **Late Disseminated Stage (months to years after tick bite):**\n* Chronic Lyme arthritis: Persistent or intermittent swelling and pain in affected joints.\n* Neurological complications that may persist or worsen, including impaired muscle movement, memory problems, and sleep disturbances.\n* Rarely, chronic Lyme carditis: Prolonged heart rhythm disturbances that can be life-threatening if not treated.\n\nIn summary, the manifestations of Lyme disease include a range of symptoms depending on the stage of infection, including skin rashes, flu-like symptoms, neurological and cardiac problems, and joint inflammation. Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial to prevent complications and chronic conditions.",
